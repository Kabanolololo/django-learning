## 📺 Episode 2 — Setup & Installation (used commands)

In this episode I learned how to create a Django project and a Django app, and how to work with a virtual environment using Pipenv.

### 🔧 Commands used in the video

- `pipenv shell`  
  Activates the virtual environment created by Pipenv, so all installed packages and commands are isolated for this project.

- `pipenv install django`  
  Installs Django inside the virtual environment and adds it to the project dependencies.

- `pip freeze`  
  Displays a list of all Python packages installed in the current environment together with their versions.

- `django-admin startproject myproject`  
  Creates a new Django project called **myproject** with the default project structure.

- `python manage.py startapp myapp`  
  Creates a new Django application called **myapp** inside the project.

- `python manage.py runserver`  
  Starts the local development server so the project can be viewed in the browser.
